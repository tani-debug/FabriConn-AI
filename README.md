FabriConn AIFabriConn AI is a platform designed to create a more sustainable and accessible fashion ecosystem. We connect customers with local tailors and fabric shops, making it easier to alter, repair, and create custom clothing while supporting local businesses and reducing textile waste.The Problem We're SolvingThe fashion industry is a major contributor to environmental waste. Many consumers struggle to find local, reliable services for clothing repair and alterations, leading to garments being discarded long before the end of their lifecycle. At the same time, skilled tailors and small fabric shops often lack a strong digital presence to attract new customers.How It WorksOur platform acts as a bridge, offering a centralized hub for both consumers and businesses.For Customers: Easily discover and book services with local tailors for alterations, repairs, and custom orders. Find fabric shops in your area, including those offering deadstock materials at a discount.For Tailors & Fabric Shops: Manage your services, accept new orders, and showcase your work. Fabric shops can list and sell excess inventory (deadstock) to a new audience.AI-Powered Features: Our AI tools assist with fair price suggestions for tailors, and a "Fit Passport" helps customers keep track of their measurements.Core FeaturesFind a Tailor: Search for tailors by location, services offered (e.g., blouse stitching, repairs), and customer ratings.Deadstock Marketplace: A dedicated section for fabric shops to sell their leftover or surplus fabrics, promoting circular fashion.Dashboard: A personalized dashboard for customers and business owners to track orders, earnings, and sustainability impact.Services: A clear breakdown of services, from simple repairs to full upcycling projects.Our ImpactBy connecting local artisans with consumers, FabriConn AI helps:Reduce Textile Waste: Encouraging repair and upcycling keeps clothes out of landfills.Support Local Economies: Providing a digital storefront helps small, independent businesses thrive.Promote Sustainable Practices: Making it easy to choose mending and reusing over buying new.Getting StartedTo get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/FabriConn-AI.git](https://github.com/your-username/FabriConn-AI.git)
